Portfolio project on optimising a sentiment analysis

This project analyzes comments from the Guatemalan radio program 'Por Favor No Se Enoje' on YouTube to understand public sentiment. Using a technique called machine learning, I trained a model to automatically identify whether comments express negative, neutral, or positive feelings. This is achieved by identifying patterns and keywords within the text. Our results show the model can accurately classify comments, helping us gauge public opinion on the program's discussions and providing valuable insights for understanding audience engagement.
